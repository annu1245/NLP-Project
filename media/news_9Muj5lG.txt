Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has increased the rebate limit for individual taxpayers from ₹ 5 lakh to ₹ 7 lakh a year. "Currently, those with income up to ₹ 5 lakh do not pay any income tax in both old and new tax regimes. I propose to increase the rebate limit to ₹ 7 lakh in the new tax regime. Thus, persons in the new tax regime, with income up to ₹ 7 lakh will not have to pay any tax," Ms Sitharaman said while presenting Budget 2023 in parliament today. She also announced new tax slabs and scrapped the old twin-structure system that was unboxed in 2020, which taxed citizens under 25 per cent without exemptions and 30 per cent with exemptions allowed.
